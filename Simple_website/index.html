      <p style="text-align:left">Hi, My name is Ghanem Ghanem and I am a student at the University of Windsor.I am currently in the CS 
		Software Engineering specialization program. I started My first year fall 2019, it was a new experience for me , with a much bigger class 
		than I thought possible.Thanks to my previous Highschool(Massey) the first year was easy, with many of the subjects I already learnt in 
		highschool. However there was a big learning curve , it was up to myself to make sure that I keep track of all my classes.Unlike highschool were 
		teacher constatnly remind you of what is due and what you need to do, University you must take it on yourself to make sure that you undestand what
		is going on in the class, otherwise you risk falling behind.Making new friends was also a great experience at the University,many different people 
		from all around the world coming together to learn and improve themselves creates a pleasing environment</p>
	  	<p style="text-align:center">one of the things I like about the University of windsor is the staff.The Office staff were decent but what really surprised me was 
		the professors. In highschool we were told that professors were heartless teaching machines who will leave you behind as soon as you make a mistake.But so far
		most of my professors showed more care than even my highschool teachers.They would make specific dates just to discuss different subjects or to recieve feedback
		from students.This was very different than what my old teachers used to do.Many of them didn't really care about our complaints and would usally just ignore them.
		But here professors seem to really care about feedback and always try helping students when they can.Overall I've been satisfied with the teaching experience 
		at the University of windsor.
	  <p style="text-align:right">Enough about school lets talk about some sports. I have played over the years.Basketball is my favourite sport since
		childhood.I started getting into basketball around 6th grade and never stopped playing.It was a fast pace experince, something I wasn't used to
		since all my family loved soccer.Never really enjoyed soccer ,it was too slow most of the time you are waiting around for something to happen.Basektball
		on the other hand has you moving every minute , no breaks.as soon as someone shoots the ball everyone is already on the other side of the court.This
		the intensity i loved about basket ball.I also love volleyball,although I haven't played that much of it ,it was really fun playing with friends
		especially when it got really competitve.Volleyball you need to be aware at all times, once you send the ball to the other side it's sure to come back 
		in less than 10 seconds and by that time you need to be ready to hit it back.It had similar intesity to Basketball which was really appleaing to me.</p>
